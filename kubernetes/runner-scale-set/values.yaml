# ARC Runner Scale Set Helm values - Small runners
# Chart: oci://ghcr.io/actions/actions-runner-controller-charts/gha-runner-scale-set
#
# This uses Docker-in-Docker (DinD) mode with a full pod template.
# We don't use containerMode.type=dind because we need custom resource limits.
# DinD allows workflows to run docker commands (build, run, compose, etc).
